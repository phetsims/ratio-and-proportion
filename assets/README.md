Ratio and Proportion assets
================

## .wav sound files

All sound assets are used as a backup of sound designed project files, and could be used to work on or maintain
the `.mp3`
sounds in this sim.

## Sim Icons

These ai files were converted into SCENERY/Path instances by taking the drawing math from SVGs and pasting them into
KITE/Shape instances. To do this. . .

1. Load the `ai` file, and export the icon as an svg
2. Open the SVG, and copy the contents of the `d=". . . "` attribute.
3. These `ai` file creations were designed so that the svg has a single `d` attribute.

### Hand Icons

The hands in the ratio are SCENERY/Paths taken from SVG drawing data in `filledInHand.ai` and `cutoutHand.ai`. The
`Path` instances are created in ratio-and-proportion/js/common/view/RatioHandNode.js.

### Tick Mark Icons

The icons used for the tick mark radio buttons SCENERY/Paths taken from SVG drawing data in `tick-marks.ai`. The `Path`
instances are created in ratio-and-proportion/js/common/view/TickMarkViewRadioButtonGroup.js.
