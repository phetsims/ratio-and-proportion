/**
 * A short sound to indicate when a movable component has reached the boundary of its movable bounds. This sound supports
 * playing a boundary sound based on horizontal motion, as well as vertical motion, but treats each as separate values,
 * and not as a Bounds2. This is to support some interactions (alternative input through keyboard) that only support vertical
 * movement (and thus only vertical boundary sounds). While terms are named and grokked in x/y directions, this could be
 * used generally when you need a boundary sound to occur always on one axis, and optionally on another.
